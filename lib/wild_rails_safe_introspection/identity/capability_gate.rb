    # CapabilityGate defines the interface that tool handlers use to check
    # whether a caller has the capability to perform a specific action on
    # a specific resource.
    #
    # In v1, this is a transparent stub: all authenticated callers are
    # permitted all actions. When wild-capability-gate ships, this module
    # becomes the integration point — replace the stub logic with a real
    # gate check without changing the call sites.
    #
    # Integration contract for Epic 10:
    #   CapabilityGate.permitted?(request_context, action:, resource:) → boolean
    #
    # See 009-AT-ADEC-capability-gate-interface.md for the full contract.
